# Practical 3
Feature Engineering & Model Selection

## Overview
In [this practical](https://github.com/KF5012-AI2021/Practical3) you will learn how to engineer, extract, and select features from different types of data; be introduced to classification models; and perform model selection over parameters of your model. Leading to machine algorithms that can perform well on a wide range of data types.

## What is in this Practical Session
1. Polynomial Features
2. Model Selection
3. Classification Models
4. Image Data
5. Exercises

It is suggested to read the notebooks in the above order. You can also try the Exercises while you read through the notebooks
